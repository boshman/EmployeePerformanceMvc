EmployeePerformanceMvc - A project for learning the ins and outs of ASP.Net 4 MVC
======================

The only purpose of this project is for a couple classic ASP.Net web page developers to figure out how MVC works and why the ASP.Net community is moving in this direction. The goal is to be objective, but some of us are very skeptical that MVC with it's magic around naming conventions, is really such a good idea.

To get a feel for what MVC can do, we are going to build an employee performance evaluation system. The system will allow employees to enter a list of goals and then to review those goals with their manager. The Home page will provide a list of employees and will allow for filtering, paging and sorting. The filter box will use jQuery autocomplete to help users build filters.

Managers will be able to create Employees. Employees will do self-appraisals. Managers will appraise their employees. All of these functions will have associated CRUD Views.

Entity Framework will be used to access the database. Forms authentication and OAuth will be implemented.

A Unit Testing project is also included in the solution so we can learn how that works as well.
